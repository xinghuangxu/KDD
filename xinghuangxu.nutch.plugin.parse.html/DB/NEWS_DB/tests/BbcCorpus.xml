With the country stuck in its fifth successive year of recession, Greek politicians must on Wednesday night vote on a fresh round of spending cuts and tax hikes totalling 13.5bn euros ($17.3bn; £10.8bn) - the fourth such package since the debt crisis started three years ago. On Sunday there is a second vote to approve Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras' proposed budget for 2013. The austerity measures include a two-year increase in the retirement age from the current average of 65, salary and pension cuts and another round of tax increases. 7 November Parliament votes on austerity measures totalling 13.5bn euros 11 November Parliament votes on revised Greek budget for 2013 12 November Eurozone finance ministers expected to take a decision on the next tranche of funds worth 31.5bn euros Mid-November Greece says it will run out of money without further aid Both these reforms and the proposed budget must be passed for Greece to receive its next tranche of 31.5bn euros of aid, which is already on hold from the end of September. Any chance of getting approval for a subsequent softening of its 130bn euro bailout terms also hinges on these votes. Without the 31.5bn euros, needed to recapitalise Greece's banks, Mr Samaras has warned the country will run out of money by the middle of this month, and descend "into chaos". With the left-wing and socialist members of the fragile coalition government wavering, Mr Samaras has insisted that these cuts will be the "very last", with the only other option a eurozone exit leading to what he has estimated would be an 80% drop in the standard of living. "We promised to avert the country's exit from the euro and this is what we are doing. We have given absolute priority to this because if we do not achieve this everything else will be meaningless," Mr Samaras added. So will the vote secure Greece's future in the eurozone? Many analysts say it is not threatened in the short term. Despite strong public opposition, demonstrated by the 48-hour "mother of all strikes" by Greece's two biggest unions, the votes on austerity measures and the budget are expected to be passed by a narrow majority. However, from the point of view of the troika of inspectors from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Union and the European Central Bank (ECB) whose job is to ensure Greece can repay its debts, the key issue is not the approval of the measures, but their implementation. Mr Samaras' revised budget last week predicted that Greece's total debt would peak at 192% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2014 and only reduce slowly, indicating the near-impossibility of Greece meeting the troika's deadline of cutting its debt to GDP ratio to 120% by 2020. If Greece has not made sufficient progress on reforming its finances, then the troika cannot authorise the release of further bailout funds. Panos Skourletis, spokesman for the main opposition Syriza party, argues implementation is unlikely. "These measures may be voted through, but they cannot be enforced because the tolerance levels of Greeks have really passed their limits," he said. IHS Global Insight economist Diego Iscaro is equally pessimistic: "The real problem with Greece is implementation. This is a deeply rooted institutional problem that makes implementing reform difficult. For example, despite taxes going up, tax collection has fallen because evasion is high," he told the BBC. Mr Iscaro believes that ultimately to keep Greece in the eurozone, it will need "significant" debt relief, an option he warns is "politically toxic" for stronger eurozone members such as Germany. It could also strengthen the case for other struggling countries such as Spain and Italy to negotiate similar deals. Despite these evident hurdles, the IMF is reported to be considering a number of such options, including the ECB and eurozone writing off some of their loans or Greek bondholders selling their debt back to Greece at a discount. A third option under consideration is eurozone countries revising the terms of loans they made to Athens, such as cutting the interest rate or extending the repayment period. So it may be that the meeting of finance ministers on Monday will not yield an immediate deal. The likely approval of the austerity measures and the subsequent vote on the budget may simply be the next steps in Greece's story, not a definitive conclusion. "It is simply sticking plaster after sticking plaster. Greece doesn't appear to have the administrative structure to deliver on what it promises," says Investec economist Victoria Clarke. "Essentially the vote buys Greece time. It will have a real fight if it does want to stay in eurozone."</body><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18094883</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-13798000</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18074674</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19959759</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-13361934</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18287476</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17549970</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18338616</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19711689</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18951575</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-16290598</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20082810</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18868704</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18284747</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18560234</Related></document><document><id>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20293058</id><Title>BBC News - Greece MPs approve new austerity budget amid protests</Title><Date>2012/11/12 09:40:36</Date><body>The budget was passed by 167 votes to 128 Greek lawmakers have approved the 2013 budget involving large spending cuts, despite mass public street protests. The budget was passed by 167 votes to 128. The move was a pre-condition for Athens to be granted a 31.5bn euro (£25bn; $40bn) EU/IMF loan necessary to stave off bankruptcy. In Athens, more than 10,000 people protested outside the parliament. The vote comes as eurozone finance ministers are due to discuss the Greece crisis at a meeting in Brussels. Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, who is due to attend the summit, earlier warned that without the new loan, Athens would start running out of money within days. The problem that he faces is that it could take some weeks before the EU backs the new instalment, BBC Athens correspondent Mark Lowen reports. The measure will have to be approved first by some parliaments, including Germany's. Many of the austerity measures contained in the budget had already been passed by parliament, in a controversial vote last Wednesday. The budget foresees a deepening of the worst recession of any country in modern history, our correspondent says. The national economy is expected to shrink next year by 4.5% and public debt is likely to rise to 189% of GDP, almost double Greece's national output. This year, public debt stood at 175%. The head of Syriza, a left-wing opposition party, said the budget cuts would leave Greeks unable to afford essential goods this winter. "This is why we say you are dangerous for this country," Alexis Tspiras said, telling the government: "You are incapable of negotiating." As MPs inside parliament debated the budget late on Sunday, marchers outside brought the centre of the capital to a standstill. Members of the Communist-affiliated Pame union, the private sector GSEE union and the public sector Adedy union had urged parliament to reject the budget. But there was none of the violence seen last Wednesday when protesters attacked riot police with petrol bomb and the police responded by firing tear gas. Evangelos Venizelos, whose socialist Pasok party is part of the governing coalition, warned European partners that any delay in pushing through the loan worked against Greece and the eurozone as a whole. "The country is at its limits," he said. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said nobody opposed the next slice of loan funding, but the Greek government should have met the conditions for it months ago. Former Greek MP, Elena Panaritis: "This just hurts the same people over and over again" "We are not responsible for the urgency. All those concerned have known the deadlines for a long time," Mr Schaeuble said in an interview with Die Welt newspaper. The next tranche of bailout loans for Greece has been delayed for months, becoming as much a political symbol as a financial one, the BBC's Chris Morris in Brussels reports. Eurozone governments have not decided how they will pay for it, our correspondent says. So there are still plenty of questions surrounding Greece and the whole strategy of austerity-based reform. A final report is still awaited from the main lenders - the European Commission, the IMF and the European Central Bank - on the progress of reforms Athens has signed up as part of the bailout deal.</body><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18094883</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-13798000</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20221105</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18074674</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19959759</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-13361934</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18287476</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17549970</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18338616</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19711689</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18951575</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-16290598</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20082810</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18868704</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18284747</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18560234</Related><Related>http://www.hellenicparliament.gr/</Related><Related>http://europa.eu/index_en.htm</Related></document><document><id>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20319787</id><Title>BBC News - Syria: France backs anti-Assad coalition</Title><Date>2012/11/13 20:19:18</Date><body>France has become the first Western power to recognise Syria's opposition coalition as the sole legitimate representative of the Syrian people. The move was announced by President Francois Hollande at a televised news conference in Paris. Syrian opposition groups struck a deal in the Qatari capital Doha on Sunday to form a broad coalition to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad. The US and Britain have both signalled support for the coalition. But they stopped short of recognising it as a government-in-exile. Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) states have declared the coalition to be the sole legitimate representative of the Syrian people. Opposition and human rights activists estimate that more than 36,000 people have been killed since the uprising against President Assad's rule began in March 2011. By becoming the first Western power to recognise the Syrian National Coalition, France is hoping to build on the success of Sunday's meeting in Doha and set a precedent that other nations may follow. No-one has forgotten that it was France that set the pace when it came to recognising the Libyan opposition last year. That was under a different, arguably more gung-ho president - Nicolas Sarkozy - and the circumstances in Libya were very different. But France likes to feel it still has a special role to play in the Middle East, and this was a welcome opportunity for Francois Hollande to make a foreign policy mark. The president's remarks on reconsidering arms deliveries need to be treated with caution. Nothing will happen quickly, not least because France is bound by an EU embargo on arms deliveries to all sides in the Syrian conflict. Still the president did say that with the coalition now officially recognised, the question of arms could be re-opened - and that will be seized on by the opposition as an important advance. More than 408,000 Syrians have fled to neighbouring countries, and more are fleeing every day, according to the United Nations. Mr Hollande told reporters: "I announce today that France recognises the Syrian National Coalition as the sole legitimate representative of the Syrian people and as the future government of a democratic Syria, allowing it to bring an end to Bashar al-Assad's regime." BBC Arab affairs analyst Sebastian Usher says Mr Hollande's announcement is a clear sign that the West is now pinning its hopes on the Syrian opposition finally being able to offer a united and effective alternative to President Assad. The National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces has been calling on European nations to recognise it as the country's transitional government, enabling it to buy weapons to assist its attempts to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad. Mr Hollande said France would look at the question of arming the coalition, but that it would not support doing so "as long as it wasn't clear where these weapons went". "With the coalition, as soon as it is a legitimate government of Syria, this question will be looked at by France, but also by all countries that recognise this government," he said. In Washington, state department deputy spokesman Mark Toner said the US regarded the National Coalition as "a legitimate representative" of the Syrian people. "We now have a structure in place that can prepare for a political transition," he told reporters. "But... we're looking for it to still establish the types of technical committees that will allow us to make sure our assistance gets to the right places." Earlier, UK Foreign Secretary William Hague described the coalition's formation as a milestone, but said it still had to prove itself. "We want to see that they have support inside Syria," he said. "That is a very crucial consideration. "If they do all these things, yes, we will be able to recognise them as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people." His comments came after the head of the coalition, Mouaz Alkhatib, called for diplomatic support as Arab and European ministers met in Cairo. "I request European states to grant political recognition to the coalition as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people and to give it financial support," he said in an interview with Reuters news agency. "When we get political recognition, this will allow the coalition to act as a government and hence acquire weapons and this will solve our problems."</body><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17258397</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20302512</Related><Related>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/64105000/jpg/_64105499_64105496.jpg</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20171828</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20272649</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20085993</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-19914444</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20079317</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19934101</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19882416</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-19331551</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13216195</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10338256</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18084964</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-15798218</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20300356</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18582755</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18957096</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17868325</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13247375</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/arabic/</Related><Related>https://www.facebook.com/Syrian.Revolution</Related><Related>http://www.sana.sy/index_eng.html</Related><Related>http://www.syriahr.com/</Related></document><document><id>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20315424</id><Title>BBC News - 'Perfect' Archduke Joseph diamond sells for $21m</Title><Date>2012/11/13 22:58:59</Date><body>There were tense scenes in Geneva as the diamond's price crept up and up One of the world's most admired diamonds has been sold at auction for more than 20m Swiss francs ($21m;£13m). The 76-carat Archduke Joseph diamond, described as internally flawless, comes from India's famous Golconda mines. The diamond was sold to an anonymous bidder by the Christie's auction house in Geneva. The price was well above the $15m (£9m) pre-sale estimate, and was far in excess of the $6.5m (£4m) it reached when it was last sold in 1993. "It is a world record for a Golconda diamond and a world record price per carat for a colourless diamond," Francois Curiel, director of the international jewellery department at Christie's, told reporters. "The market is not on the best form at the moment. The sale tonight was almost flabbergasting." The diamond's seller, American jeweller Black, Starr &amp; Frost, said they thought it would be "going to a museum", Reuters news agency reports. Christie's specialist, Jean Marc Lunel, said the Archduke Joseph is prized because it boasts the highest quality of shape, colour and clarity that can be found in a diamond. And it has an illustrious history. The diamond came from the ancient Golconda mines, where the famous Koh-i-Noor and blue Hope Diamond originated. It was named after Archduke Joseph August of Austria, a prince of the Hungarian line of the Habsburgs, who reportedly deposited it in a bank vault in 1933. "Three years later it was sold to a European banker, and kept in France, locked away in a safe deposit box, where fortunately it remained undiscovered during World War II," the auction house said. Decades later it surfaced at auction in 1961 and again at Christie's in November 1993.</body><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-17108778</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15746900</Related><Related>http://www.christies.com/sales/geneva-jewels-november-2012/</Related></document><document><id>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-20321386</id><Title>BBC News - China party congress wraps up ahead of leadership unveiling</Title><Date>2012/11/14 06:36:47</Date><body>China's Communist Party has concluded a week-long congress, a day before unveiling its new leadership line-up. More than 2,200 delegates met to select a new Central Committee in Beijing's Great Hall of the People. That committee will meet on Thursday to endorse China's top decision-making body, the Politburo Standing Committee. The new line-up will be keenly watched for signs of China's future economic and political direction. In a closing statement, President Hu Jintao said the congress had "replaced older leaders with younger ones" and made decisions of "far-reaching historical significance", Xinhua news agency said. China's leadership change happens every 10 years. The party congress opened on 8 November with a televised work report from Mr Hu, but since then the decision-making has been taking place behind closed doors. While votes are held, key selections are in reality decided in advance by top leaders, with the Politburo Standing Committee line-up to be revealed at 11:00 (03:00 GMT) on Thursday. Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang are expected to become party leader and deputy respectively. Mr Xi is also expected to take over from Hu Jintao as China's president in March 2013. Both were appointed to the Central Committee, Xinhua news agency confirmed, as were the leading contenders for inclusion in the Standing Committee. Vice-Premier Wang Qishan, propaganda chief Liu Yunshan, party organisation chief Li Yuanchao, Tianjin party boss Zhang Gaoli and Vice-Premier Zhang Dejiang are all thought to be front-runners. But the exact composition of the committee - which could be reduced from nine to seven members - will not be clear until it is formally announced. The full list of Central Committee members has not yet been revealed. Members are usually leading figures of the party, government and army. Many current members are past the retirement age, so it is widely expected that at least half of the next committee will be new faces, says the BBC's Raymond Li. The committee meets every year to make decisions on major policies and is also responsible for appointing the most powerful people in China. But, our correspondent says, sometimes decisions are made by the politburo and then sent to the committee for final approval, leading some to call it a rubber-stamp. The party congress also approved Mr Hu's work report and added his Scientific Outlook on Development theory into the party constitution, Xinhua said. Analysts say there has been division at the very top of the leadership in the lead-up to the congress, with two rival factions jostling for position and influence. Recent months have also been dominated by the scandal involving former Chongqing party leader Bo Xilai. His wife has been jailed for murdering a British businessman and he looks set to face trial on a raft of corruption-related charges. Across China, meanwhile, recent cases of official corruption have stoked public anger and there have been a series of high-profile mass protests focusing on land grabs and environmental issues. Mr Hu, in his speech, said the party had to better tackle corruption issues or risk fatal damage, echoing a warning issued 10 years ago. "If we fail to handle this issue well, it could prove fatal to the party, and even cause the collapse of the party and the fall of the state," he said.

A judge said he had no doubt Khalid Aldawsari, convicted in June of trying to use a weapon of mass destruction, was serious about his plans. The FBI found bomb-making materials in the 22-year-old's Lubbock, Texas home just before his February 2011 arrest. Nuclear power plants and hydroelectric dams were also on his list of targets. At the sentencing in Amarillo, Texas, Judge Donald Walter said: "The bottom line is that but by the grace of God there would be dead Americans. "You would have done it. In every step, it was you all alone." The investigation into Aldawsari began when his $435 (£273) purchase from a chemical company raised suspicions. Investigators said he had ordered the toxic chemical phenol, which can be used to make explosives, telling the supplier he wanted it for "off-campus, personal research". The supplier became suspicious and reported the contact to the FBI. Aldawsari later cancelled the order, the justice department said. He eventually succeeded in buying nearly eight gallons (30 litres) of concentrated nitric acid and three gallons of concentrated sulphuric acid, prosecutors said. Just before he was arrested, federal agents secretly searched his apartment and found explosive chemicals, wiring, a hazardous-materials suit and clocks, along with videos showing how to make the chemical explosive TNP. The FBI found evidence that Aldawsari had researched targets, including the Dallas home of Mr Bush, which the student referred to as "Tyrant's House". Aldawsari wrote in a journal entry: "And now, after mastering the English language, learning how to build explosives and continuous planning to target the infidel Americans, it is time for Jihad." Aldawsari apologised at Tuesday's hearing: "I am sorry for these bad actions, but none of these bad actions did harm to the United States." During the trial, defence lawyers acknowledged the student had intent, but they said he never took a "substantial step" to carry out an attack. FBI bomb experts said the amounts of chemicals Aldawsari gathered would have yielded almost 15lb (7kg) of explosive - about the same amount used per bomb in the 2005 London subway attacks. Other potential targets Aldawsari researched included the homes of three former soldiers who were stationed at Abu Ghraib prison. His internet searches also suggested he was considering hiding explosives in children's dolls or targeting a nightclub with a bomb in a backpack. He came to the US legally in 2008, initially studying chemical engineering at Texas Tech before transferring to South Plains College to study business. A Saudi industrial company was paying his tuition and living expenses.</body><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-12887039</Related></document><document><id>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-20243883</id><Title>BBC News - Mali's long wait to reclaim the north from Islamists</Title><Date>2012/11/08 17:27:56</Date><body>As details emerge about a military plan to recapture parts of Mali currently occupied by Islamist rebels - involving up to 4,000 soldiers mostly from West African nations - some in Mali doubt that it will be a success. Like many former French colonial towns in Africa, Mopti, in northern Mali, was built to maximise luxury for its rulers. In the administrative quarter of the town - a trading post between the Sahara desert in the north and the Sahel in the south - grand, Mediterranean-style colonial buildings overlook the picturesque river Bani. The Bani and the river Niger together almost surround the town, creating a deceptive sense of lazy calm, and transforming Mopti into a one-time tourism hub for Mali and the whole West African sub-region. A small jetty on the river is home to a few dozen (traditional covered canoes) that, not long ago, transported tourists all the way from Bamako - Mali's capital, 900 km (600 miles) to the south - to Timbuktu, the ancient town and world-heritage site in the Sahara. Hundreds of foreign visitors savoured the slow journey along the river, taking in the savannah landscape, camping overnight and eating local food cooked over small fires by their guides. Now the same guides, mostly young men, sit listlessly on their pinasses, playing cards or staring into space. More than half of the long boats have already been taken off the water, they say, their owners unable to repair wear and tear as their source of income has steadily dried up. Nearby, the Hotel Kanaga - the grandest of Mopti's hotels - insists it is open. But it has had no electricity for days. And does not have a single guest. Ever since a military coup toppled the civilian government in March, and Tuareg separatists and al-Qaeda linked fundamentalists seized control of the entire north of the country, the once popular tourist hub has been transformed into one of the most dangerous places in the world. Mopti is the last government controlled town in Mali and only 50km (30 miles) from the area where Islamist control begins. But not all the businesses in Mopti are floundering. Papou Siby, a jovial, chubby man, tells me trade is booming. His bar, Fiesta, attracts many young women who have fled al-Qaeda rule, enjoying their newfound freedom to dress up and go out for a drink in the evening. "My bar is doing fine," said Mr Siby. "Before the Islamists came to the north, these young women were ordinary people. Mali is a liberal society," he told me, "these women want to drink, dance, smoke, just like everyone else. But those who stay on in their occupied towns, they're unable to do anything." Mr Siby added that Fiesta was also a popular drinking spot for the numerous soldiers based in the city. They come drinking at 22:00 every evening, seeking light relief from the approaching likelihood of a war to reclaim the north. Last month a United Nations Security Council resolution paved the way for an international military intervention in Mali. With the Mali army and troops from the Economic Community Of West African States (Ecowas) fighting on the ground and the US and the EU providing logistical support and training. "The situation is extremely serious," says Boubakar Hamadoun, editor of the newspaper Mali Demain (Mali Tomorrow). "A military intervention is the only thing that can save the country now," he says. "It's the least the international community can do to support us. Our so-called friends stood by whilst we lived for years with the facade of a democracy and whilst the army fell apart, with no training and no resources. Now we have a tragedy on our hands, how can anyone be surprised?" And yet, Mr Hamadoun said, Malians do not like Ecowas. They remember what happened in Liberia and Sierra Leone. "The troops did not create a good impression there," he told me. "Plus Ecowas troops don't know the terrain in the north of Mali and they will not be welcomed by the people. It's like Vietnam," he said. "It should be the Malian army to recapture the north. If we are given the means and the weapons, then we can do it." At the army barracks - elsewhere in Mopti, preparations are under way for the impending war in the north. The base is one of the largest under government control. Heavy tanks swelter in the sun and soldiers mill around running errands whilst their superiors sit and drink tea in the shade. On the road driving from Bamako to Mopti, we passed not one but four army vehicles - heavily loaded trucks tilting sideways towards the bush as they languished, broken down, on the side of the road. "How can this army fight a war in the desert?" said Arber Kadi, who drove with me on the long road north. "They can't even cope with the drive to Mopti."

This all hung in the balance in early 2012, when the steady collapse of state control over the north of the country was followed by an inconclusive military coup and West African regional plans for armed intervention with UN backing and some European support. For several decades after independence from France in 1960, Mali suffered droughts, rebellions, a coup and 23 years of military dictatorship until democratic elections in 1992. Country profiles compiled by The core of ancient empires going back to the fourth century, Mali was conquered by the French in the middle of the 19th century. After a brief experiment in federation with Senegal, Mali became independent in 1960. Although swathes of Mali are barren, the country is self-sufficient in food thanks to the fertile Niger river basin in the south and east. It is one of Africa's major cotton producers, and has lobbied against subsidies to cotton farmers in richer countries, particularly the US. A chronic foreign trade deficit makes it nonetheless heavily dependent on foreign aid and remittances from Malians working abroad. In the early 1990s the nomadic Tuareg of the north began an insurgency over land and cultural rights that persists to this day, despite central government attempts at military and negotiated solutions. The insurgency gathered pace in 2007, and was exacerabated by an influx of arms from the 2011 Libyan civil war. The Saharan branch of al-Qaeda was quick to move into this increasingly lawless area, and seized control of the Tuareg north after the March 2012 military coup, effectively seceding from the rest of Mali and establishing a harsh form of Islamic law. The West African regional grouping Ecowas agreed to launch a coordinated military expedition to recapture the north at a meeting in Nigeria in November, with UN backing. Preparations are expected to take several months. Despite its political travails, Mali is renowned worldwide for having produced some of the stars of African music, most notably Salif Keita. The annual Festival in the Desert celebrates this talent.</body><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-20243883</Related><Related>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/64022000/jpg/_64022121_boat_mopti_thinkstock624x35.jpg</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-20086980</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19372083</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18814291</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18870130</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18723035</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18674596</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17582909</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18057916</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17583772</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17481114</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17192212</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14118852</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13036732</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13037572</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13040376</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13072774</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13085064</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13146029</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13148486</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13150040</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13164686</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13229685</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14121191</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13283212</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13231761</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13313370</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13317174</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13349078</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13349398</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13376333</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13376517</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13433790</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13442051</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13443186</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13287216</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13681341</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13728324</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13729504</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13754897</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13861843</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13864367</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13881370</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13881985</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13882233</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14121438</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13890416</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13890726</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13943662</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13949550</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14093238</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14093493</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14093674</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14093816</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14094194</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14094503</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14094760</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14069082</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14094995</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14095303</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14095776</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14106781</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14107241</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14107906</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14112449</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14115176</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14113249</Related><Related>http://www.koulouba.pr.ml/</Related><Related>http://www.maliweb.net/</Related><Related>http://news.bbc.co.uk/weather/hi/country_guides/newsid_9384000/9384150.stm</Related></document><document><id>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17582909</id><Title>BBC News - Mali crisis: Who's who?</Title><Date>2012/06/29 09:28:54</Date><body>Mali is in the grip of an unprecedented political crisis, one of the most serious since the landlocked West African country gained independence from France in 1960. Rebels, some of whom have links to al-Qaeda, are now in control of the north of the country - one of the poorest in the world. The army seized power in March, accusing the elected government of being soft on the rebels - but while the military was distracted, the rebels made rapid advances. Under a deal brokered by the West African regional bloc Ecowas, the country has now returned to civilian rule - with Mali's parliamentary speaker sworn in as interim president on 12 April. But political uncertainty remains and plans are being made to send an African intervention force to restore order. Here is a guide to some of the main players in Mali. Dioncounda Traore, 70, has long harboured presidential ambitions - but he had hoped to come to power through the ballot box by contesting elections originally scheduled for April. Mr Traore has 40 days in which to organise elections - though analysts say that deadline is not likely to be met. He was born in 1942 in the garrison town of Kati, just outside of the capital Bamako. He pursued his higher education in the then Soviet Union, Algeria and France, where he was awarded a doctorate in mathematics. He returned to Mali to teach at university - before getting involved in politics. He was a founding member in 1990 of the political party Alliance for Democracy in Mali and between 1992-1997 he held various ministerial portfolios including defence and foreign affairs. In 2007, he was elected as speaker of the National Assembly. He was an ally of the deposed President Amadou Toumani Toure, who had become deeply unpopular. As a consequence, many Malians are wary of Mr Traore - who is not seen as charismatic, Bamako-based journalist Martin Vogl says. This boiled over in May, when supporters of the coup attacked Mr Traore in his office, forcing him to seek medical treatment in France. The 21 March coup seems to have been spontaneous, arising out of a mutiny that erupted at the Kati military camp located about 10km (six miles) from the presidential palace in Bamako. It was led by a mid-ranking army officer Capt Amadou Sanogo, one of the few officers who did not flee the Kati camp when the rank-and-file soldiers began rioting and then headed for the seat of government. Capt Sanogo, who is in his late 30s, is from Segou, Mali's second largest town some 240km (150 miles) north of Bamako, where his father worked as a nurse at Segou's medical centre. Journalist Martin Vogl in Bamako describes the army officer as a forceful, confident and charismatic man, friendly but with a slightly abrupt manner. In the army all his professional life, Capt Sanogo received some of his military training in the US - including intelligence training. Capt Sanogo has hinted that he may play a future role in Mali's politics - despite formally handing over power. The National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA) and Islamist Ansar Dine are the two major Tuareg groups involved in the takeover of the north of Mali - an area the size of France. Other small groups have also taken part in the fighting, including the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa (Mujao). Despite having very different aims, MNLA and Ansar Dine have joined forces to fight together from time to time, including in the capture of Timbuktu - but there are serious tensions between them, which have bubbled over into clashes between the two groups. The MNLA grouping wants independence for the Tuareg's northern homeland, which it calls Azawad. A statement released by the MNLA said that were in control of the north they would stop fighting and begin their "mission of defending and securing the territory of the Azawad, for the happiness of its people". Two important figures in the MNLA are the general secretary Bila Ag Cherif and Mohamed Ag Najim, the head of the movement's military wing. In the ranks of the MNLA are Malian Tuareg who, while in exile in Libya, fought alongside Col Gaddafi's forces as he tried to cling to power in Libya. Once he was toppled, they returned to Mali - well-trained and with plenty of heavy weaponry. But it is the Islamists of Ansar Dine and Mujao who now control all three of the region's main cities - Timbuktu, Gao and Kidal. Ansar Dine is led by a renowned former The group has ties to al-Qaeda's north Africa branch, known as al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. There are unconfirmed reports of foreign jihadist fighters, possibly including Nigeria's Boko Haram, setting up training camps in rebel-held areas. Ansar Dine says it has not been fighting for independence - it wants to remain part of Mali but wants to introduce Sharia across the whole country, which is largely Muslim. Mali analyst Andy Morgan says the Islamists are much richer than the MNLA as they have been earning money in recent years by kidnapping Westerners for ransom and trafficking cocaine, hashish and cigarettes. He estimates that the MNLA has 2-3,000 fighters - about the same as the Islamist groups combined. The rise of the Islamists has raised fears among neighbouring countries, such as Niger which has a large Tuareg population, to ask the UN to approve plans to send a 3,000-strong African force to Mali to stablise the government in the south and even to try to reclaim rebel-held territory. But some point out that this could be more difficult than it sounds and no firm decision has been taken. Amadou Toumani Toure - the army general widely credited with rescuing Mali from military dictatorship and establishing democracy in Mali - was deposed as president by a coup in March. Known as ATT, his term of office was due in April anyway and on 8 April he formally resigned. However, after several of his allies were subsequently arrested, he fled to neighbouring Senegal. Mr Toure himself first came to power in a coup in 1991 - overthrowing military ruler Moussa Traore when security forces killed more than 100 pro-democracy demonstrators. He handed power back to civilian rule the following year - gaining respect and the nickname "soldier of democracy". He went on to win presidential elections in May 2002, and was re-elected in 2007. But he became deeply unpopular as people became increasingly frustrated with his government for doing little to tackle corruption and the growing insecurity and eventual rebellion in the north. Born in 1948, ATT has no official party - and had always sought the backing of as many political groupings as possible.</body><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-20243883</Related><Related>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/64022000/jpg/_64022121_boat_mopti_thinkstock624x35.jpg</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-20086980</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19372083</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18814291</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18870130</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18723035</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18674596</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18057916</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17583772</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17481114</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17192212</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13881370</Related><Related>http://www.mnlamov.net/</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/afrique/</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/africa</Related></document><document><id>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-20302604</id><Title>BBC News - Watching Japan and China square off in East China Sea</Title><Date>2012/11/13 00:37:08</Date><body>BBC Newsnight finds growing nationalism in Japan over the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands Who do the Senkaku or Diaoyu Islands belong to? The short answer is I don't know. Japan once had a small colony there for a few decades. But they left in the 1940s. No-one has lived on the remote islands since the end of WWII. As a piece of real estate they are not very attractive. Only one is big enough to be, just possibly, habitable. But to therefore dismiss the islands as an irrelevance would be a mistake. China has long claimed them, and is now for the first time aggressively asserting that claim. It is equally clear Japan is not about to give them up, and is possibly prepared to fight to keep them. It is, in other words, a very dangerous situation. The only way to get to the islands is by fishing boat. It is not a particularly pleasant journey. In late October, the seas were choppy. The small 12m (39ft) fishing boat we had chartered pitched and rolled constantly. Inside the cabin the engine-noise was almost unbearable. After 10 hours ploughing through the waves, the islands hove in to view through the pre-dawn light. But between our boat and the islands were two large, white coastguard cutters. Out of the gloom, a pair of speedboats came skipping across the waves towards us. The coastguard officers were extremely polite, but made it clear we must stay at least one mile off shore. Japan has banned all civilians, including Japanese, from landing on the island. It is to stop right-wing Japanese nationalists, who have in the past attempted to build a lighthouse and other structures there. It is exactly the same reason the Japanese government gives for "nationalising" the islands in September; to stop right-wing nationalists taking control of them. When Japan and China established diplomatic relations in 1972, the leaders of both countries agreed to put the issue of the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands to one side; to let future, supposedly wiser, generations deal with the problem. They both also agreed that neither side would unilaterally change the status quo. That is what China says Japan has done by "nationalising" the island. Beijing is now using that alleged change to justify its own assertion of sovereignty. As the sun rose higher over the island the radio on board our fishing boats crackled into life. It was the Japanese coastguard. "Chinese ships are heading in this direction, please immediately move around to the north of the island!" Over the horizon we could see them coming: first two, then two more. Large, white Chinese ships with four blue stripes down the side. Our fishing boat captain didn't need asking twice. He was off. We sped round to the north of the main island. But the Chinese boats kept on coming. A Japanese P3 Orion surveillance plane then appeared from the east, swooping back and forth over the Chinese ships. The Japanese coastguard was now extremely nervous. "Please stop filming and leave the area immediately," came the message from the radio. "They're worried the Chinese will come and board us," said the captain. If that happened it could turn into an international incident. I don't think that was really ever the Chinese intention. Their job was pretty simple, to brazenly sail through Japanese-controlled waters, while loudly proclaiming them to actually be Chinese. The Chinese tactics are aggressive, but not too aggressive. The ships are "civilian" not naval. The aim is to wear down the Japanese resolve, to make Chinese control of the waters around the islands at least equal to that of the Japanese. The Japanese government does not appear to have a counter strategy. We watched as the Japanese coastguard ships shadowed the Chinese ships, always keeping a distance. After the anti-Japanese violence in China in September, Tokyo is understandably reluctant to do anything to antagonise Beijing further. But China's communist leadership, caught up with the 18th party congress, has shown no interest in dialogue. Indeed, President Hu Jintao's speech at the opening of the congress last week was a very public statement of China's determination to build a powerful blue-water navy and enforce its territorial claims. Such rhetoric is making people in Japan nervous of China's intentions and more susceptible to the calls of right-wingers like Shintaro Ishihara, the former governor of Tokyo. He is one of many on the right who say it is time for Japan to scrap its pacifist constitution, and prepare to defend itself.</body><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11710880</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-20030681</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-19945071</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-20103483</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-20134564</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-20069627</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-19703672</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-19797989</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-19953767</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19876372</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-20293590</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-20248850</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-20247679</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-20179952</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-20273007</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-20224221</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-20134699</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-20217333</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-20203937</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-20041320</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-19987295</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-19827537</Related></document><document><id>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18560234</id><Title>BBC News - Eurozone's long reform wishlist</Title><Date>2012/06/26 11:39:45</Date><body>Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti claimed Europe had "one week to save the euro" ahead of yet another crunch EU summit on Thursday and Friday. France's president has called for a "growth pact", Tony Blair has urged a "grand bargain", the markets demand a "big bazooka", while in Germany there are rumblings about federalism. Yet the economic and financial solutions to the eurozone crisis are actually surprisingly straightforward. How so? Easy. Just ask how the exact same problems have been solved by the members of that other large (and much better functioning) single currency area - the United States of America. Europe's real problem is that almost all of the solutions are far from politically palatable. The eurozone's root problem is that - their wages rose too quickly during the boom years, which led them to import a lot more than they exported, and borrow the difference. The southern economies' excessive debts, persistent uncompetitiveness and resulting need to continue borrowing - along with Germany's reluctance to give them the money - is what has driven the financial panic that has made it much harder for southern European governments and banks to borrow from markets. What's more, the seizing up of European financial markets - not to mention the collective determination of Europe's governments to cut spending, and the European Central Bank's focus on price stability - is threatening to push the entire continent into a long and deep recession, something that would merely compound the debt problems. So, if the eurozone were to look at the US model for inspiration in its hour of need, what sorts of changes - economic, financial and, ultimately, political - might need to be considered? Europe's most immediate task is to restore confidence in its banks. All the made by eurozone banks (loans to mortgage borrowers, property speculators and even governments that may not be fully repaid) may need to be cleaned up (by injecting money into the banks), with the potential losses borne by the eurozone as a whole - because many national governments probably cannot afford it. In the case of Spain's banks, the current bailout deal leaves Spain's government sitting on all the losses. at all eurozone banks may need to be guaranteed by the eurozone as a whole, in order to stop panicky investors from moving their money from banks in southern European countries at risk of exiting the euro, to Germany (and increasingly to Switzerland and Denmark). All of Europe's banks may need to be placed under a of regulation and supervision, with troubled banks given equal access to rescue loans, and being wound up by a central authority when they go bust. Europe's biggest long-term conundrum is how to stop governments like Spain or Italy going bust - and restore confidence in their commitment to stay within the euro - while ensuring that all governments are more responsible with their finances in future. is . A large chunk of eurozone government debt may need to be amalgamated - with governments standing behind each other's finances - in order to reinforce the commitment of governments to staying in the euro: In the long-run, a US-style may be needed to cover the cost of recessions, so that individual governments don't risk going bust when their national economies get into trouble. For example, the cost of a minimum level of social security - especially unemployment benefits - could be permanently shared across the eurozone, paid for by a common income tax. The new French President Francois Hollande was elected on a platform demanding a "growth pact" in Europe - a set of reforms designed to boost European economies and mitigate the pain being inflicted by government spending cuts across the continent. The may need to have its mandate changed so that it has an explicit dual target to support employment as well as price stability, just like its American counterparty, the US Federal Reserve does, as proposed by Mr Hollande. The eurozone may need to pay for large-scale , particularly in southern Europe, much in the way that West Germany invested in rebuilding East German after reunification in 1990. Proposals on the table include increasing the European Investment Bank's ability to lend, and to finance major construction. All Europeans (and especially southerners) are having to implement that will increase their long-term growth and strengthen government finances (although at the risk of hurting growth in the short-term). These include removing restrictions on market competition, raising the retirement age, laying off (over many years) a lot of state employees, and making it much easier to hire and fire employees. Mr Hollande has resisted many of these reforms in France. "Rebalancing" means solving the big underlying competitiveness problem faced by southern Europeans that led to their economies racking up so much debt in the first place. The ECB and German government may need to stimulate high in Germany for several years in order to eliminate the country's current massive competitive trade advantage over southern Europe - . In the same way that Washington helps out struggling US states, the southern European governments may need to be given money ( , not ) by the rest of the eurozone via direct , so that they can afford to prop up their economies until they have regained their competitiveness. These transfers could end up taking the form of bailout loans that are never repaid. Structural reforms - particularly labour market reforms - also play a key role in rebalancing, by ensuring that wages in southern Europe do not rise too quickly, as they did in the past decade. To make a full banking, fiscal and monetary union work, the eurozone governments would need to hand power to a (the European Commission) that can pay for and supervise all of the above, while national governments accept that in future they have to keep their own spending strictly within their limited means. As most of the above reforms involve Germany sharing its wealth with the rest of Europe (and all European nations handing power to Brussels), Berlin is insisting on the principle of no taxation without representation - in other words a move towards full , with spending and regulation controlled by a of the European Commission.</body><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18094883</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-13798000</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20221105</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18074674</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19959759</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-13361934</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18287476</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17549970</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18338616</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19711689</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18951575</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-16290598</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20082810</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18868704</Related><Related>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18284747</Related></document></Corpus>
